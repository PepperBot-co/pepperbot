## Types

The "Types" directory contains the type definitions for various entities in the project.

### Directory Structure

```
- components
  |-- component1
  |   |-- Component1Types.ts
  |-- component2
  |   |-- Component2Types.ts
  |-- ...
- types
  |-- shared
  |   |-- SharedTypes1.ts
  |   |-- SharedTypes2.ts
  |   |-- ...
  |
  |-- other-types.ts
```

### Components Types

The type definitions specific to each component should be located within their respective component folders. For example, `component1` will have its own types defined in `component1/Component1Types.ts`, `component2` in `component2/Component2Types.ts`, and so on.

Please note that the components' types are not included directly in this directory, but rather in their corresponding component folders.

### Shared Types

The shared types that are used across multiple components can be found in the `shared` directory. These types are defined in separate files such as `SharedTypes1.ts`, `SharedTypes2.ts`, etc. They can be imported and used by different components as needed.

### Other Types

Additional types that do not belong to a specific component or fall under the shared types category can be placed in the `other-types.ts` file within the "Types" directory.

By organizing the types in this way, it helps maintain a structured and modular approach to managing type definitions within the project.
