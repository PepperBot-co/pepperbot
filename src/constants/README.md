# Constants

The "constants" directory contains TypeScript files that define constant values used throughout the project. Constants are useful for storing values that are reused multiple times and may need to be changed in a centralized location.

## Directory Structure

```
- constants
  |-- Constants1.ts
  |-- Constants2.ts
  |-- ...
  |-- index.ts
```

## Usage

To use the constants defined in this directory, import them into your TypeScript files as needed.

```typescript
import { CONSTANT_NAME } from '@pb/constants';

// Use the constant in your code
console.log(CONSTANT_NAME);
```

## Additional Information

Feel free to provide any additional information or instructions related to the usage or configuration of the constants in this directory. You can also include any relevant details specific to your project or the constants you have in the directory.

Remember to update this README file with accurate and up-to-date information as you add or modify constants within the "constants" directory.
